I quite enjoy writing low-level code, so don't be surprised if you see me making projects in assembly or stuff like that xD
<br/>
#1 OOP hater
<br/><br/>

Currently trying to make:
  * Text Editor written entirely from scratch with C and support for plugins
  * Programming language
  * UI library (similar to [clay.h](github.com/nicbarker/clay/blob/main/clay.h)) for C in C (because using other's software is bad and ofc I need to make my own UI layout library if I want to work with GUIs)
  * WebSite so I can record my progress with blogs and maybe teach others :P

A little weird fun fact is that as a programmer I have a lot more of knowledge in theory than in practice, but I'm trying to change this xD
<br/>
I'm on this for 5 years, but only started doing it for real some months ago (before I didn't even store my projects on github), so I guess it makes sense? 

### Contact-me

If you want small talk, add me on discord. Please no NSFW stuff. My nickname there is `viktor_hg`.

I can speak english half-decently, my true native language is Brazilian Portuguese. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

If you also want help with something programming-related, I encourage you to contact me - not because I know everything, but because helping people is always a good thing and you can always earn so much (learn, if you will so) by trying to help someone with somethig.
